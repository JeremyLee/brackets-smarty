# Smarty for Brackets #

A simple Adobe Brackets extension that enables Smarty syntax highlighting for
the .tpl file type. The functionality already exists in CodeMirror, and this
extension simply enables it.

### Installation ###

 - Click **File > Extension Manager**
 - Search for "Smarty Syntax Highlighting"
 - Click **Install**

### Additional Information ###

The .tpl file type is assigned by default to the HTML language. This extension
removes the .tpl extension from the HTML language before defining the Smarty
language.
